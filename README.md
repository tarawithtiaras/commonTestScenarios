# A Resource for Testers, so we don't have to reinvent the wheel
Open-Source Style listing of common test scenarios for common components

---
## The Idea
The idea isn't mine. The idea came from a friend of mine, [@AutomationPanda](https://github.com/AutomationPanda).
> Why donâ€™t we open our tests like we open our source?

Well, it's a great question (and a great talk, so check out his website and his videos and blogs).


## Getting started
- Pick a standard web application page or component (ie, shopping cart, registration page)
  - Each will be in their own folder
- Create a list of the common scenarios for that component
- Include and reference any screen captures or images to show examples

### Additional Work
- Write tests in an agnostic form for manual testing
- Write tests in specific languages as needed
  - Leave a list of variables at the top that can be replaced for use
